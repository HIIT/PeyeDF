- `pupil_surface_tracker.patch`: Difference between the defalt surface tracker provided by pupil labs and the modified version that includes fixations (for future reference).
- `Pupil plugins`: Plugins for the pupil labs capture software. Includes a surface tracker that maps fixations to surfaces (in addition to gaze points). These should be placed in `~/pupil_capture_settings/plugins/`.
- `Surfaces`: Contains surfaces for 2d tracking of gaze (or fixations). A surfaces_definitions file should be placed in `~/pupil_capture_settings` to track its corresponding background. Backgrounds were prepared for a Macbook Pro Retina 15" with display set to one step larger than default scaled resolution.
